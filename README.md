# Sudoku JS Example

This repo contains an example or showcase on programming to be shown to primary school kids.
Hopefully this will help to show what programming is about and what it looks like.
The idea is to show some source code and run the application presenting an empty Sudoku table.
After filling in the numbers from an example you can start to solve the puzzle.
But ... you can also automate things:

1. Which numbers are missing in a row?
1. Which numbers are missing in a square?
1. Next possible number can be filled in!
1. This can be done in a loop !! :-D
1. Wait! Now solving the puzzle is automated ... My job has gone!

That's exactly the point! Programming is the automation of everything you do; automate yourself away! (so you can have holidays !! :-)
